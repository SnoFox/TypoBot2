## About TypoBot2 ##

TypoBot2 is a spellchecker bot designed for use on IRC.
It will scan messages from users who opt into the bot and notice them corrections to failures.
TypoBot2 works by sending requests to Aspell through PHP's pspell functions.
It also supports corrections via regex and plaintext string replacements.

## Usage ##

TypoBot2 is configured by the config/config.php file, and further configuration is offered in config/words.php
Both "config files" are PHP source code which is simply included into the bot.
Launch the bot by executing typobot.php any way you see fit.
--
Usage on IRC:
/msg <bot> spell -- Will turn on automatic spelling corrections
/msg <bot> reload -- Will reload config/words.php for dynamic updating.
In channel:
!spell <string> -- Checks <string> for typos and messages the channel any corrections.



## Reasoning for this file ##
Although the bot itself is simple, dirty, and still needs work
this file is solely to prevent GitHub from whining about no README file. :)
